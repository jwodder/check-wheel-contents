Check wheel files for appropriate contents

Getting the right files into your wheel is tricky, and sometimes we mess up and
publish a wheel containing ``__pycache__`` directories or ``tests/``.  Do we
have to manually check the contents of every wheel we build before uploading it
to PyPI?  How about letting this program check for you?  Just run
``check-wheel-contents`` on your wheel, and it'll fail and notify you if any of
several common errors & mistakes are detected.  The errors are described in the
README, along with common causes and corresponding fixes.
